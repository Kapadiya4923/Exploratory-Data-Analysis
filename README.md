# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Loan Application dataset CSV file. EDA reveals insights about variables and their relationships, aiding in understanding and validating statistical techniques. I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot graphs, derive conclusions, and enjoy the data analysis process.
